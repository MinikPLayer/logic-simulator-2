Maybe use a color pallete for setting wire colors?

Idea for block compiler.

Each part should have a function that does the same as the logic of the part does such as for NAND:

func nand(a, b):
    return not (a and b)

For NOT:

func not(a):
    return not a


Example compiled circuit:

func io(a, b):
    return nand(not(a), b)

So, a gdscript file is generated, and this may be loaded and instanced with .new()

--- Bugs ---
Duplicate of expanded IO part results in extra LineEdit child node being added to the part.
