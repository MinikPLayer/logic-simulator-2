Maybe use a color pallete for setting wire colors?

There could be a part that is only used for setting a wire or bus color when a
 wire or bus is connected to it.

Need pin name editor widget for general parts.

Duplicate of expanded IO part results in extra LineEdit child node being added to the part.
