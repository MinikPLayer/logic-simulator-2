Running Tests

Set a "Tests" folder path in the settings.
	Have a folder selection popup.

Add "Run Test" menu item to Tools.
The circuit title should match the test file name e.g. AND => AND.tst
Warnings are produced for:
	No test folder has been set.
	Circuit has no title.
	Test file not found.
	Compare file not found.
	Circuit is missing IO pins.

After the tests are applied, a summary window is popped up with a report.

Circuits could be have a data parameter to record test status.

Maybe use a color pallete for setting wire colors? - Enable recent colors in Color selector.

--- Bugs ---
Duplicate of expanded IO part results in extra LineEdit child node being added to the part. But a work-around has been added.

There is a wild right-click menu popup on the Part Tag text label to consider.

When quitting the App, the quit process cannot be intercepted (unless via ESC) and halted. Need to make sure that new settings are saved.
